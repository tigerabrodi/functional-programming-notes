1. Functional programming is a mindset, not tied to a specific language
2. Core principle: Define transformations declaratively rather than mutating state
3. Functions are central - they're treated as values and can be passed around
4. Approach: Breaking problems into smaller functions, then composing them together
5. Benefits include:
   - Code that's easier to reason about (linear reading)
   - Less code through reuse
   - More compiler checking, fewer bugs
   - Immutable values and no side effects
   - Better modularity
