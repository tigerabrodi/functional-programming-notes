## Understanding Types of Polymorphism

Let me break down the two main types of polymorphism mentioned:

### 1. Parametric Polymorphism (Generics)

This is when you write a single implementation that works for many types:

```typescript
// One implementation works for ANY type
function toString<A>(value: A): string {
  // Single implementation that somehow works for all types
  return String(value);
}
```

The key is that you have **one implementation** that must work the same way for all types.

### 2. Ad-hoc Polymorphism (Type Classes)

This is when you have different implementations for different types, but with a unified interface:

```typescript
// Interface defining the capability
interface Show<A> {
  toString(value: A): string;
}

// Specific implementation for numbers
const numShow: Show<number> = {
  toString: (n) => n.toFixed(2),
};

// Specific implementation for strings
const strShow: Show<string> = {
  toString: (s) => `"${s}"`,
};
```

The key is having **different implementations** for each type, united under a common interface.

## Type Classes Explained

A Type Class is essentially a way to define a group of types that support certain operations. Instead of thinking "this is a number" or "this is a string," we think "this is a type that can be shown" or "this is a type that can be compared."

In the example above, `Show` is a Type Class that groups all types that can be converted to strings.

## Type Classes at the Kind Level

What makes Type Classes really powerful is they can work not just with concrete types, but with type constructors (higher-kinded types):

```typescript
// A Type Class for anything that can be mapped over
interface Functor<F> {
  map<A, B>(fa: F<A>, f: (a: A) => B): F<B>;
}

// Implementation for Option
const optionFunctor: Functor<Option> = {
  map: (fa, f) => (fa.tag === "none" ? none : some(f(fa.value))),
};

// Implementation for Array
const arrayFunctor: Functor<Array> = {
  map: (fa, f) => fa.map(f),
};
```

This lets us write functions that work with any "mappable" container, not just one specific container.

## Common Type Classes

The transcript mentions several important Type Classes:

1. **Functor**: Types that support mapping operations (`map`)
2. **Applicative**: Functors that can apply wrapped functions to wrapped values
3. **Foldable**: Types that can be "folded" into a single value (like array reduce)
4. **Monad**: Types that support sequential, dependent operations

Each of these represents a different capability or behavior that a type can implement.

## Practical Benefits

Type Classes give you:

1. **Code Reuse**: Write operations once that work for many types
2. **Flexibility**: Add new behaviors to existing types without modifying them
3. **Type Safety**: Get compile-time guarantees about operations
4. **Abstraction**: Focus on behaviors rather than specific types

## TypeScript Limitations

Unfortunately, TypeScript doesn't natively support higher-kinded types or Type Classes. Libraries like `fp-ts` provide workarounds using interfaces and type parameters, but they're more verbose than in languages like Haskell or PureScript.

In a nutshell, Type Classes are a powerful way to organize code around behaviors rather than types, allowing for polymorphic operations that still get specialized implementations for each type.
