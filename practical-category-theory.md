## Practical Takeaways from Category Theory

1. **Design your functions to be composable**

   - Create small, focused functions that do one thing well
   - Ensure output types of one function match input types of others you'll likely compose with
   - This makes your code more reusable and testable

2. **Use function composition instead of nesting**

   - Instead of `f(g(h(x)))`, prefer `compose(f, g, h)(x)` or `pipe(h, g, f)(x)`
   - Makes code more readable and easier to modify
   - Most FP libraries provide compose/pipe helpers

3. **Leverage existing patterns from functional programming**

   - Map: Transform each element in a collection (functor pattern)
   - Filter: Keep elements that match criteria
   - Reduce: Combine elements into a single result
   - These are all mathematically sound operations from category theory

4. **Use sum types (tagged unions) for better modeling**

   - For states that can be one of several possibilities
   - Examples: `Result<Success, Error>`, `Option<Value>`
   - Makes impossible states impossible to represent in your code

5. **Separate data and operations**

   - Define your data structures
   - Create pure functions that transform those structures
   - This separation makes your code easier to understand and test

6. **Think in transformations**
   - See your program as a pipeline of data transformations
   - Data flows through a series of pure functions, each changing its shape
   - This mental model is easier to reason about than state mutations

## Concrete Example in Code

```typescript
// Instead of this:
function processUserData(user) {
  if (!user) return "No user";
  const name = user.name || "Anonymous";
  const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  return greeting.toUpperCase();
}

// Prefer this composable approach:
const getNameOrDefault = (user) => user?.name || "Anonymous";
const createGreeting = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
const shout = (text) => text.toUpperCase();
const processUser = (user) =>
  user ? pipe(getNameOrDefault, createGreeting, shout)(user) : "No user";
```

These practical patterns will improve your code regardless of whether you remember the category theory behind them. The key insight is that composition of small, pure functions leads to more maintainable and testable code.
